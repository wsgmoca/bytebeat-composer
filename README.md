## Collection of songs

Songs lists are stored in JSON format, compressed with GZIP in `/data/library/*.gz` files.<br>
Songs codes larger than 1KB are stored in `/data/songs/*/*.js` files.<br>
To maintain your own library of songs:

1. Create a MySQL database on your server.
2. Set up PHP with the MySQLi extension on your server.
3. Copy `settings.default.php` to `settings.php` in the root directory.
4. Configure `settings.php` with your database settings.
5. `chmod` write permissions to the `/data` directory.
6. Go to your Bytebeat Player page > "Settings" section > "Manage library" link.
7. Log in using the admin password you set in `BYTEBEAT_ADMINPASS` in `settings.php`.
8. The management panel is now available.

The following management functions are provided:
- "Migrate to database" button &ndash; to fullfill your database with songs from `/data` library files.
- "Make library files" button &ndash; to generate `/data` library files from your database.
- "Add a song" button &ndash; opens a form to add a new song.
